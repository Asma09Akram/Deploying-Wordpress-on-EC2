### What is WordPress

WordPress is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) that allows users to create and manage websites and blogs.
It is one of the most popular CMS platforms globally, powering millions of websites across various industries, from personal blogs to large corporate websites.

WordPress is built on PHP and uses a MySQL or MariaDB database. Its modular architecture allows users to extend its core functionality through themes for design and 
layout and plugins for additional features and functionality.

###  Hosting WordPress on Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) offers several benefits:

**Customization and Control**: When you host WordPress on EC2, you have full control over the server environment. You can choose the operating system, install additional software, and configure settings according to your needs. This level of customization is not possible with shared hosting services.

**Scalability**: EC2 allows you to scale your resources up or down based on demand. If your WordPress site experiences increased traffic, you can easily resize your EC2 instance or add more instances to handle the load. This scalability ensures optimal performance during peak times.

**Cost-Effective**: EC2 offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You only pay for the compute resources (CPU, memory, storage) you use. Additionally, you can take advantage of reserved instances or spot instances to save costs further.

**Security**: You can implement security best practices specific to your WordPress installation. For example, you can set up firewalls, configure security groups, and manage access control lists (ACLs). Regularly updating your server and WordPress software helps keep your site secure.
